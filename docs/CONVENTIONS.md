# Repository Conventions

This document is the single source of truth for **how we work in this repo**.
It exists so that contributors — human and agent — can answer "where does this
information go?" and "how do I propose a change?" without guessing.

It is deliberately opinionated. If a convention here doesn't fit your case, the
right move is to propose a change via RFC, not to ignore it.

## Document hierarchy

We separate documentation by **two axes**:

- **Audience.** Internal (contributors, agents working on the code) vs.
  external (users of the product).
- **Lifecycle.** *Living* (must match current reality), *frozen*
  (immutable history), or *governance* (in-flight proposals).

Mixing these is the most common source of documentation rot. The hierarchy
below assigns every kind of doc to exactly one bucket.

```

`/ARCHITECTURE.md`, when present, is the concise descriptive system model:
responsibilities, allowed dependency edges, state ownership, flows, extension
points, enforced invariants, and deeper current-state links. It is optional;
add it when a repo has more than one subsystem or a boundary the directory
tree cannot make clear.

Architecture documents have three roles. `overview.md` is **descriptive** —
the map of how the code is organized today, read to find things.
`reference.md` is **normative** — the golden path (stack, building blocks,
component stereotypes, cross-cutting standards) that new work conforms to, the
target a feature's low-level design steers by. The system model explains the
system, the map tells you where things are, and the golden path tells you how
new things should be shaped. A thin repo has only the map; the golden path
appears once there are real architecture decisions to hold work to.

The bottom layers cite the upper layers; upper layers do not know about
lower layers. That's the whole point of the hierarchy.

**The delivery-brief altitude.** A *delivery brief*
(`docs/product/briefs/<slug>.md`) sits between the roadmap and the specs — it
is where a multi-feature delivery handoff (a PRD, a solution packet, or
repo-authored coordination brief) lands when it is too big to be one spec. The
altitude reads `roadmap → delivery brief → spec → AC`: the roadmap names
themes, a delivery brief records one outcome and the specs that deliver it, a
spec is the engineering contract for one feature, and an acceptance criterion
is the testable unit. A delivery brief owns only **this repo's slice**; an optional
`Epic:` field points up to an external coordinator when the work spans repos.
A derived spec links back to its brief with a `Brief:` field (see § 4), and
the brief's coverage map rolls up automatically from those specs' `Status:`
fields. Use `author-delivery-brief create` for raw input or
`author-delivery-brief continue` for an existing brief; it never mandates a
schema beyond the load-bearing delivery contract.

## Document lifecycle

Every doc in this repo belongs to one of three lifecycle classes, and the
maintenance rules differ:

| Class | Files | Rule |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Living** | `CHARTER.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `architecture/*`, `product/*`, `guides/*`, active `specs/*` | Must match current reality. Updated in the same PR as any change that affects them. Drift is a bug. |
| **Frozen** | `adr/*`, shipped `specs/*`, accepted/rejected `rfc/*` | Immutable history. Status fields can change (Accepted → Superseded), bodies cannot. |
| **Governance** | open `rfc/*` | In flight. Updated through the RFC process, not direct edits. Closes to Frozen on acceptance/rejection. |

**The most important property of this scheme** is that the frozen layer
gives you decision history *without* the burden of keeping it in sync.
Living docs can be honest about the present because they don't have to
also be a record of how we got here. That's what ADRs are for.

### A spec directory freezes as a unit, when the spec ships

`shipped specs/*` above means the whole directory — `spec.md` **and** `plan.md`.
This needs saying because the plan template's own contract line reads "Unlike
the spec, this document is allowed to change as you learn", which sounds like a
standing exemption and is not one. That licence is **phase-scoped**: it holds
while the plan is `Drafting` or `Executing` — while there is still something to
learn. Once the plan is `Done` and the spec is `Shipped`, the work is over and
both documents are history. A plan that stayed editable forever would be a
second, unversioned account of what we did, competing with the ADR that records
why.

So: before ship, the plan is Living and you edit it freely. After ship, it is
Frozen and gets exactly the same treatment as its spec.

### Superseding a frozen document

A later decision often reverses part of an earlier one. The earlier document
still describes what was true when it shipped, so it is not wrong — but a
reader who starts there must not be left following a rule we no longer keep.

**The pointer goes in the `Status` field, and only there.** That is the one
field this table already makes mutable on a frozen document, so no new
exemption is needed. Form:

```
- **Status:** Shipped (superseded in part by ADR-NNNN — <what changed>; everything else stands)
- **Status:** Done (superseded in part by ADR-NNNN — <what changed>; everything else stands)   # plan.md
```

Four rules, each earning its place:

1. **Say "in part" and say which part.** A bare "superseded" invites a reader
   to discard a document that is mostly still correct.
2. **Point at the ADR, not at the spec that implemented it.** The ADR is the
   decision record and is where the reasoning lives.
3. **Annotate both ends — between ADRs.** The superseding ADR names what it
   supersedes; the superseded ADR points forward. A one-way pointer only helps
   readers who already arrived from the right side.

   The **spec end is deliberately one-way**: ADRs do not cite specs (see
   § *Cite upward*), so a superseded spec points at the ADR and the ADR does not
   point back. That is the intended asymmetry, not a gap to close.
4. **Do not change the body's meaning — including "just adding a line".** An
   append is a body edit. The residue is real and accepted: someone who greps
   mid-file still lands on the old rule with no pointer in view. The mitigation
   is that the *operative* instruction lives in a Living file at the point of
   use (a config header, a linter's message), not that the frozen record is
   patched.

   **Carve-out: meaning-preserving mechanical rewrites are allowed** — a path
   or link rename, a moved file's reference, a repo-wide identifier change.
   `84d79223` ("lift `docs/guides/` to `guides/`") rewrote references across
   156 files under `docs/specs/`, shipped specs included, and was right to.
   What freezes is the *record of the decision*, not the spelling of a path
   that has since moved; a frozen document with dangling links is a worse
   record, not a purer one. The test is whether a reader's understanding of
   what was decided changes. If it does, it is not mechanical.

These four rules are **convention-enforced, not machine-enforced**: the linter
checks the status token's vocabulary and nothing else. A reviewer is the only
thing standing between a supersession and a one-way, unscoped, or body-editing
annotation.

**The same carrier, for a pointer that is not a supersession.** A frozen
document sometimes names a `workspace.toml [backlog].open` anchor — "Deferred as
`<slug>`", "recorded as `<slug>`" — and the PR that works the entry deletes the
slug, leaving the prose pointing at nothing. A reader then cannot tell whether
the work was done or lost, and `lint-spec-status.py` invariant (iv) does not
catch it: it checks `(deferred: <slug>)` markers only. Record it on the `Status`
line, in the same form and under the same carrier. **Rules 3 and 4 hold
unchanged** — the pointer is one-way and no body line moves. **Rules 1 and 2 do
not apply**: nothing was superseded, so there is no part to scope and no ADR to
point at; name the spec that closed the anchor, which is the only record there
is. Say plainly that it is not a supersession, so a later reader does not
discount a document that is entirely still correct. Form:

```
- **Status:** Shipped (§ <section>'s register anchor `<slug>` was closed by
  <spec>; not a supersession — every decision here stands)
```

Link the closing spec, the way the supersession form links its ADR; the
placeholder above is unlinked only so the repo's own link check does not chase
it.

**Not `Constrained by:`.** It is the better semantic fit — it is the field that
cites governing decisions — but it is a record of what governed the spec *at
ship time*, and that record is still accurate. Editing it would rewrite history
rather than annotate it, and would extend mutability to a second field for no
gain. (`Constrained by:` *can* carry a supersession clause —
`docs/specs/copilot-full-parity/spec.md` does exactly that — so the argument is
that `Status` is the shorter carrier already licensed here, not that it is the
only one capable of it.)

The work-loop's `lint-spec-status.py` reads only the leading token (it
truncates at the delimiters listed in § *Spec metadata contract*), so the
annotated form still satisfies invariant (i). Confirm that by running it against
the edited file, not by trusting this paragraph.

## 1. Charter — `docs/CHARTER.md`

**What:** one page. Mission, scope, and principles. The foundational
document. Modeled on the [CNCF charter pattern](https://contribute.cncf.io/maintainers/governance/charter/).

**Lifecycle:** living, but rarely changed. Mission, scope, and foundational-principle
changes are reserved; wording, clarification, examples, typos, broken links, and
accepted decisions are normal PRs regardless of pathname.

**What goes here:**

- **Mission.** One sentence. What the project is, in language anyone
  could understand.
- **Scope.** What the project does, and — equally important — what it
  doesn't. The "doesn't" list is what tells contributors and agents when
  a request is out of bounds.
- **Principles.** Five to seven values that resolve ties. Each principle
  has a one-sentence elaboration with a concrete example.

**What does NOT go here:**

- Decision history → ADRs.
- Current product state → `product/`.
- Roles, voting, decision-making → `GOVERNANCE.md`, *if* the project is
  large enough to need one.
- A glossary → `guides/reference/`. Vocabulary is reference material.

**On governance docs:** small and medium projects don't need a separate
`GOVERNANCE.md`. A maintainer or small group operating by consensus is
fine. Add governance documentation when there are roles, decision
procedures, or election processes worth writing down — typically when
the project has external contributors who need clarity on how to gain
authority. Forcing governance ceremony on a project that doesn't need
it produces theater, not clarity.

---

## 2. ADR — Architecture Decision Records — `docs/adr/`

**What:** an immutable record of a decision and the context that produced it.
"We chose Postgres over DynamoDB because <reasons>, accepting <tradeoffs>."

**The key property of an ADR is that it is never edited after acceptance.**
If a decision is reversed or revised, you write a new ADR that supersedes the
old one and update the old one's status to `Superseded by ADR-NNNN`. The old
text stays. This is the difference between an ADR and documentation: ADRs are
history.

**Filename:** `NNNN-kebab-case-title.md`, e.g. `0007-use-postgres-for-primary-store.md`.
Numbers are sequential and never reused.

**Status values:** `Proposed` → `Accepted` or `Rejected`. An `Accepted` ADR may
later become `Deprecated` (the decision no longer applies and nothing replaces
it) or `Superseded by ADR-NNNN` (a specific later ADR replaces it). A `Rejected`
ADR is kept as a record, never deleted.

**Template:** `assets/adr.md` in the `new-adr` skill that creates ADRs from it.

**When to write an ADR:**

- You're choosing between two or more reasonable options and the choice will
  be expensive to reverse.
- The reasoning involves tradeoffs a future maintainer (or agent) won't be able
  to reconstruct from the code alone.
- Someone asks "why did we do it this way?" and there's no good answer in
  writing.

**When NOT to write an ADR:**

- The decision is trivial or has only one sensible option ("we use UTF-8").
- The decision is about a single feature's internals — that's a spec, not an ADR.
- You're documenting how something works today — that's `architecture/`.

**Rule of thumb:** if you'd be annoyed to discover the decision was made without
discussion, write an ADR. If you'd shrug, don't.

---

## 3. RFC — Request For Comments — `docs/rfc/`

**What:** a proposal to change something significant — a new feature area, a
new convention, a deprecation, a breaking change to a public interface. RFCs
are *forward-looking governance*; ADRs are *backward-looking record*.

**Lifecycle:**

```
Draft → Open → Final Comment Period → Accepted | Rejected | Withdrawn
```

**Optional `Experimental` status.** An RFC that proposes running an
experiment — using an optional `Experiment / validation` section of the RFC
template — may sit in `Experimental` while the trial runs and
results are pending, instead of being forced to a premature Accept or Reject.
Results live in a linked spike note (or a follow-up RFC / superseding ADR),
not the RFC body; when they land, the RFC moves to `Accepted | Rejected |
Withdrawn`. An `Experimental` RFC is still in-flight (Governance class, not
Frozen). Use it only when an experiment is genuinely running.

Once an RFC is **Accepted**, it produces follow-on artifacts:

- Architectural decisions → one or more ADRs
- Concrete features → specs in `docs/specs/`
- Convention changes → edits to this file (the change itself, not a copy of it)

After follow-ons exist, the RFC's job is done. It stays in the repo as history.

**Optional `NNNN-notes/` companion.** An RFC may carry a sibling
`docs/rfc/NNNN-notes/` folder for promoted research and supporting material —
sketches, evidence, a distilled research brief lifted from a sustained
investigation — mirroring the optional `notes/` folder a spec carries (§4). It
is optional and informal; the RFC body remains the contract.

**Filename:** `NNNN-kebab-case-title.md`. Numbers are sequential.

**Template:** the RFC template provided by the repository's RFC workflow, if it has one.

**When to open an RFC:**

- Direction is unresolved and more than one owner must agree.
- Someone explicitly asks to circulate a proposal.
- Always reserved, taking the strongest route the repository has:
  - charter mission, scope, or foundational principles;
  - maintainer authority, approval process, or governance model;
  - a security trust model, as distinct from a security implementation;
  - withdrawal of, or a breaking change to, a stable published compatibility promise.
- Evidence only, never sufficient: package or file count, public visibility, top-level
  location, a prior ADR, or a governed-document pathname. These raise review depth;
  they do not select the artifact.

**When NOT to open an RFC:**

- Bug fix, performance work, behavior-preserving refactor, or accepted-decision
  implementation → PR; cite the decision.
- Bounded feature whose direction is settled → issue, or a spec when concrete behaviour
  and acceptance criteria need defining.
- Settled durable architectural choice, including a settled replacement for a prior ADR
  → ADR, or a superseding ADR.
- Reversible, time-bounded trial with stated exit criteria → normal implementation
  review; promote to RFC only if permanent adoption is contested.
- Conventions maintenance that preserves an obligation → PR; a changed obligation uses
  the test above; authority, mission, scope, and principles are reserved.

Without an RFC process, reserved and unresolved multi-owner decisions require owners to
reach and retain an explicit recorded decision before implementation, using the existing
mechanism; no file, pack, or configuration is required. Honour a stricter declared local
policy as an override.

---

## 4. Specs and Plans — `docs/specs/<feature>/`

**What:** the precise definition of a single feature, sized to be built in days
or weeks (not months). Each feature gets a directory.

```
docs/specs/<feature>/
├── spec.md      ← contract (objective, boundaries, testing strategy, acceptance criteria)
├── plan.md      ← strategy + construction tests, broken into tasks
└── notes/       ← (optional) research, sketches, rejected approaches
```

**`spec.md` is the contract.** Its four sections — Objective, Boundaries,
Testing Strategy, Acceptance Criteria — together define what "done" means.
The Acceptance Criteria list the observable outcomes that close the spec
(the gate, not an afterthought); the Testing Strategy names the verification
mode for each, and the artifact that verifies it lives where that mode
directs. (Hyrum's Law: with enough callers, every observable behavior of
this contract — including ones the spec doesn't promise — will be depended
on, so the criteria pin what's actually intended.)

**`plan.md` is the implementation strategy.** It enumerates the changes —
"add a `<thing>` to package X, modify `<other thing>` in package Y, write tests
for cases A, B, C". It's the work-breakdown for the spec. It is allowed to
change as you learn things — **while the plan is `Drafting` or `Executing`**.
Once it is `Done` and the spec `Shipped`, the directory freezes as a unit; see
§ *A spec directory freezes as a unit, when the spec ships*.

**Durable outputs own lasting truth.** A durable spec identifies the semantic
owners it expects to create or update before implementation starts: user
documentation, current product truth, current architecture, decision rationale,
interface or operations contracts, maintainer procedure, release history, and
reusable learning when applicable. The spec/plan pair may be retained as frozen
delivery history, but it is not a substitute for those living owners. Tests and
source remain executable capability proof; they do not preserve product intent,
rationale, authority, ownership, or non-executable operational promises.

**Lifecycle:** specs are **living documents** for the duration of a feature's
implementation. If implementation diverges from the spec, the spec is wrong;
update it in the same PR. After the feature ships the spec **freezes**: at that
point the *code is the truth*, and the spec becomes the record of what was
agreed, not a description of current behaviour. A later behaviour change is
recorded where it belongs — in the code, and in an ADR if it reverses a
decision — never by rewriting the shipped spec. When a later decision reverses
part of one, annotate its Status field; see § *Superseding a frozen document*.

**Rigor and retention are separate.** Full-mode work may still use a
local-only or PR-only spec/plan when the approved record is confined,
fingerprinted, available to every required participant, and has an independent
post-closeout evidence owner. That choice affects where the live delivery
container may reside, not the approval, gate, or review standard. If another
person, worktree, CI job, or external control plane must read the contract,
session-local memory is not enough; use an established shareable surface or
retain the record. After implementation, `close-work` settles durable outputs
and workspace coordination before any delivery container can be removed.

Guards, pre-checks, and invariant-enforcement added during implementation are
ACs, not implementation details — if they affect observable behavior (exit
codes, refusals, error messages), they belong in the spec when they're added
to the code.

**Template:** `assets/spec.md` and `assets/plan.md` in the `new-spec` skill that creates the pair.

**Cite upward, never downward:** a spec links to the ADRs and RFCs that
constrain it. ADRs do not link to specs (specs are too small and short-lived
to be worth citing from an ADR).

### Spec metadata contract

A spec's *metadata* — the few machine-checkable fields below — is pinned so the
new-spec template, the `adversarial-reviewer` drift check, and the work-loop's
finish-time checklist all measure against one source. This contract is
**metadata-only**: it governs the shape of status, criteria, and deferrals, not
whether the spec matches the code. Detecting *semantic* spec↔code drift remains
the `adversarial-reviewer`'s judgment call (its "Spec drift" check), not a
mechanical rule.

- **Status vocabulary.** A spec's `- **Status:**` field is exactly one of
  `Draft | Approved | Implementing | Shipped | Archived`. (Plans carry their own
  vocabulary, `Drafting | Approved | Executing | Done` — a separate field, separate set.)
  Approved means the spec/plan contract has received human approval. In `spec.md` it means the scope is accepted; in `plan.md` it means the implementation strategy is accepted. Before code changes begin, an implementation run moves `spec.md` to `Implementing`.
  There is **no `Superseded` token**, and `Archived` is not a substitute — a
  superseded spec usually shipped and is still live. A supersession is recorded
  as a parenthetical *annotation* on the existing token
  (`Shipped (superseded in part by ADR-NNNN — …)`). A parenthetical on that
  token is the **only edit a frozen spec accepts**, and it carries exactly two
  licensed shapes: that supersession pointer, and a pointer recording that a
  `[backlog].open` anchor the body names has been closed. Form and rules for
  both: [§ Superseding a frozen document](#superseding-a-frozen-document).
  The linter reads only the leading token — it truncates at the first ` (`,
  ` →`, or `<!--` — so annotated statuses satisfy the vocabulary rule.
- **Acceptance Criteria notation.** Each criterion is a GitHub task-list item:
  `- [ ]` when open, `- [x]` when met. "Done" is the checklist, not an opinion.
- **Acceptance Criteria opt-out.** A spec that intentionally has no
  Acceptance-Criteria section carries
  `- **Acceptance Criteria:** none — <one-line reason>` in its metadata header;
  the field name `Acceptance Criteria` and value `none` use that exact casing,
  the separator is an em dash (U+2014), and the reason is required. The linter
  applies this gate to new specs and to specs whose section is removed in the
  current diff; existing sectionless specs are grandfathered. A reasonless or
  malformed marker, or a marker alongside a real section, is a hard violation.
- **No new shipped acceptance debt.** A spec newly transitioning to `Shipped`
  has every final accepted criterion checked. If required accepted work remains,
  the spec stays `Implementing` across sessions. If the owner agrees that work
  is separable, amend the spec/plan, remove it from the final AC set, and
  record it under `## Follow-ons` with an owner and stable work-intake artifact
  or external evidence reference. The amended fingerprint receives the normal
  review and human approval before implementation resumes.
- **Historical deferral token.** Frozen specs may still contain older inline
  `(deferred: <slug>)` markers. While they exist, the marker's `<slug>` must
  resolve to a `slug` field in `workspace.toml [backlog].open`; Wave 7 owns any
  historical migration. Do not use this marker as a new shipping exception. A
  follow-on recorded only in a PR comment rots; the register or external
  artifact is the stable pointer. Run `workspace-status` to see open backlog
  items.
- **Brief back-link (optional).** A spec derived from a product brief carries a
  `- **Brief:**` header naming that brief by its repository-relative path
  (`docs/product/briefs/<slug>.md` — the brief file's real path, which
  `workspace-status` reconciliation matches against the queue entry's
  `source.parent`; a bare slug fails that check and blocks dispatch). It
  records *product provenance* and is distinct from `Constrained by:` (which
  cites the ADRs/RFCs that govern the spec). The field is additive and optional
  — a spec authored directly omits it and stays valid. The brief's coverage map
  rolls up from these back-links automatically; never hand-write a spec's status
  into the brief.
- **Discovery up-edge (optional).** A spec descended from an upstream
  product-discovery artifact (a decision brief or intent produced by an upstream
  discovery process) carries a `- **Discovery:**` header naming that artifact by
  its stable id. Like `Brief:` it records *upstream provenance* — the producer
  edge a traceability check walks from the discovery side into the spec — and is
  additive and optional: a spec authored directly omits it (or `none`) and stays
  valid. The discovery-side producer artifacts themselves (intents, screens,
  journeys, blueprints) carry a **rendered bold-body field marker** naming their
  kind — `- **Type:** screen-brief` for a screen brief, the container-embedded
  `- **Action:** <slug>` / `- **Service:** <slug>` for journey/blueprint entries,
  and `- **Kind:** outcome|opportunity` / `- **Level:** capability` for
  intent-ladder rungs — so a traceability check recognizes them **by marker, not
  path** (the lint matches the rendered `**Label:**` field, not a YAML frontmatter
  key). (`frame-domain` additionally stamps a document-level frontmatter
  `type: domain-framing` / `type: scope-boundary`; that is a discover-by-marker
  *anchor*, not one of the chain recognizers' fields.) This is a **format**
  convention — the field grammar — not doctrine about *when* discovery runs.
- **Story trace (optional).** When the brief carries user stories (Shape B), an
  acceptance criterion that satisfies a story appends a `Satisfies: US-n` marker
  so coverage is story-granular. Optional — omit it for a no-stories brief or a
  directly-authored spec.
- **Shape (optional).** A spec may carry a `- **Shape:**` header — one of
  `ui | service | data | integration | mixed` — naming the *kind* of work. It
  selects which `## Design (LLD)` sub-sections the plan scaffolds, so a narrower
  shape keeps the plan thin. Stack-neutral: it names the kind, never a framework.
  Additive and optional — a spec omits it (or sets `mixed`) and stays valid.

### Low-level design lives in the plan

The plan — not the spec — is the home for low-level design. `spec.md` stays the
contract (objective, boundaries, testing strategy, acceptance criteria); the
*how* lives in the plan's optional, shape-pruned `## Design (LLD)` section, built
from stack-neutral category headings:

- **Nine design categories** scaffold as `## Design (LLD)` sub-headings — design
  decisions; data & schema; interfaces & contracts; component / module
  decomposition; state & control flow; behavior & rules; failure, edge cases &
  resilience; quality attributes (NFRs); dependencies & integration. The plan
  scaffolds only the ones the spec's `Shape:` selects; a one-file change keeps
  the section thin or empty.
- **The tenth category — rollout & deployment — is not a Design sub-heading.** It
  is realized by the plan's expanded `## Rollout` (infrastructure, external-system
  integration, deployment sequencing). Cross-link it; never duplicate it.
- **Each sub-section traces to the acceptance criteria it satisfies and the
  contracts it implements** — the design is always anchored to something
  verifiable. No acceptance criterion lives in the design; the spec keeps the
  contract. A user-visible UI state (phrased state / trigger / outcome) and an
  NFR with a pass/fail bar each rise to the spec as acceptance criteria; the
  per-screen and per-NFR design itself sits in the plan.
- **The categories are stack-neutral; the stack is derived, never baked.** The
  headings are universal; the prose under them names a concrete stack, derived
  from a reference-architecture document (`docs/architecture/reference.md`) when
  one is present — the design conforms to it, referencing its components and
  standards by name — and degrading to detection from the established repo
  (lockfiles, build files, imports) or elicitation when it is absent.

### Contract vs. construction tests

Tests are designed *up front, before any implementation*. The contract and
the artifacts that verify it have different shapes and different lifecycles:

- **The contract** lives in `spec.md` — Acceptance Criteria name the
  observable outcomes; Testing Strategy names the verification mode for
  each (TDD / goal-based check / visual / manual QA); Boundaries names the
  rails. Any valid implementation must satisfy every criterion. The
  contract is stable against *implementation* change (that's the whole
  point); it evolves with *spec* (behavioural) change during the spec's
  living phase and freezes when the spec freezes.
- **Construction tests** live in `plan.md`, attached to each task's
  `Tests:` subsection. Units, edge cases, property tests, fixtures — they
  guide the implementer through the build and verify the Acceptance
  Criteria in concrete form. They are *revisable* if one turns out to
  over-specify an internal detail the plan changed.

Within a plan task, the **Tests** subsection comes *before* Approach. Tests
drive implementation, not the other way around. Red-green-refactor: write
the failing test, make it pass, refactor — separate commits for each when
the change is non-trivial.

**Stub → EXECUTE handoff.** For TDD-mode tasks, PLAN carries the exact test code
as the task's compilable, validated red **stub** — as much of the real failing
test as the AC and contract honestly determine, never less than a compiling
assertion on the contract surface, never a bare `TODO`. PLAN compiles and earns
the red from disposable scratch; it does not create a repository test file.
After the state machine enters `CODE-IMPLEMENTATION`, EXECUTE materializes the
approved code unchanged in the real test location, proves byte identity and the
intended red, then completes red-green-refactor. A `spec-plan` run therefore
ends with documents only and no intentionally failing test in the repository.
The full procedure and the closed no-stub exceptions live in the `work-loop`
skill's `references/tdd-stubs.md`.

This is the forcing function that keeps specs honest (every Acceptance
Criterion must be testable in its declared mode) and keeps implementations
honest (you can't drift from the spec if the criteria's verification artifacts are red).

The typical mix follows the test pyramid — roughly 80% fast unit / construction
tests, 15% integration, 5% end-to-end — a target shape, not a quota.

### Contracts — `contracts/<type>/`

API contracts are **long-lived, repo-level, single-source-of-truth** artifacts —
not per-feature files. They live at the repo root, grouped by contract type:

```
contracts/
  openapi/      # REST — .yaml
  asyncapi/     # event-driven APIs — descriptor + standalone event-payload schemas
  proto/        # gRPC / protobuf — buf-style versioned package dirs
  graphql/      # GraphQL SDL
  jsonschema/   # standalone JSON Schema
  jsonrpc/      # JSON-RPC service descriptors
  mcp/          # Model Context Protocol tool/resource schemas
```

This is distinct from `contracts/` (adapter schemas) and from the
`contracts` *pack* of authoring skills; the API tree is unambiguously repo-root
`contracts/`.

**Naming.** One contract per logical API/service/domain, kebab-case by domain
(`contracts/openapi/orders.yaml`). Proto follows buf's convention — versioned
package directories (`contracts/proto/payments/v1/payments.proto`) and
`lower_snake_case.proto` filenames.

**Versioning.** Minor/patch track in-contract (`info.version`) plus git history;
a breaking **major** that must be served alongside the old one gets a parallel
file/dir (`orders.v2.yaml`, `…/v2/`).

**Bidirectional traceability.** A contract and the specs that define or modify it
point at each other:

- **Forward (spec → contract):** the spec header `- **Contract:**` names the
  contract file(s) the spec defines or touches.
- **Backward (contract → spec):** the contract carries an `x-spec` vendor
  extension naming its defining/modifying specs (OpenAPI/AsyncAPI:
  `x-spec: [docs/specs/orders/]`); for extensionless formats (proto, graphql) a
  top-level `contracts/REGISTRY.md` map is the fallback.

Both sides are repo-scope artifacts, so forward/backward agreement is checkable
by an in-repo lint — the **traceability invariant** in `lint-spec-status.py`
(warn-only, and a no-op where no `contracts/` tree exists). Contract ↔ spec
Acceptance Criteria ↔ implementation must agree; changing one without the others
is drift. A contract is authored through its type's skill when one is installed
(so the active API standard's compatibility rules catch breaking changes);
absent a skill, it is hand-authored into the same conventional location.

## 5. Current-state docs — `docs/architecture/`, `docs/product/`, `guides/`

These three directories are the *living* layer — they describe what is, not
what was decided or what's proposed. Each serves a different audience:

### 5a. `docs/architecture/` — for contributors

How the code is *currently* organized. Not why (ADRs); not what we want
(RFCs); what is.

- `ARCHITECTURE.md` — when present, the concise system model: responsibilities,
  allowed dependency edges, state ownership, flows, extension points,
  mechanically enforced invariants, and deeper current-state links.
- `overview.md` — the map of the monorepo. What's in `apps/`, `packages/`,
  `tools/`, and how they relate.
- `<subsystem>.md` — one file per non-trivial subsystem. Describes the
  structure, the entry points, and links to the ADRs that explain why.

`architecture/` holds current state. A designed-but-unbuilt subtree is admitted
only when its index carries a `STATUS: PLANNED` marker and links to its
governing decision.

When a page carries a `Last verified against commit` marker, it records a
deliberate whole-page re-verification against that commit, not merely an edit.
Update it only after re-reading the whole page against the tree at the recorded
commit. An unchanged marker means the page has not received that full audit;
it is provenance, not a freshness requirement.

**Why separate from ADRs:** ADRs accumulate; current state has to be
reconstructed by reading them all in order. `architecture/` is the
rolled-up snapshot — the answer to "what does this codebase look like
today" without replaying history.

### 5b. `docs/product/` — for maintainers

What the product is *currently* doing. The product-side counterpart to
`architecture/`. Without this layer, you have specs (per-feature contracts)
and ADRs (decision history) but no answer to "what's the product up to,
right now?"

- `roadmap.md` — direction for the next 2-4 quarters. Direction, not
  commitments. Reviewed quarterly. Items that haven't moved in two
  consecutive reviews are a drift signal.
- `changelog.md` — user-visible changes by release, in
  [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/) format. One section per
  release, naming every artifact that release covers:
  `## [<artifact>][<version>] — YYYY-MM-DD`, where `<artifact>` is a pack or a
  published package. An entry is required in the same PR that bumps a released
  artifact's version — you know the version at write time because you are
  setting it. Repository tooling that ships in no release needs no entry. The
  heading level is load-bearing: a section carrying a version and a date is
  released, so it sits at that top level directly beneath `[Unreleased]`, never
  nested inside it. A published package also keeps its own `CHANGELOG.md`
  beside its source — `packages/<name>/CHANGELOG.md` in this layout — for
  readers who get the package and not the repository.
- `briefs/<slug>.md` (optional) — a multi-feature delivery brief and its
  auto-rolled-up coverage map. Created or continued by the
  `author-delivery-brief` skill; one file per brief. See the delivery-brief altitude under
  *Document hierarchy*.
- `personas.md` (optional) — who we're building for. Add only if it's
  actively used to make decisions; speculative personas rot.
- `shaping/` (optional) — upstream shaping artifacts: product vision docs,
  opportunity assessments, capability maps, and initiative briefs. Produced by
  the PE six-step shaping sequence and the product-strategy pack. Committed
  here because shaping artifacts are decisions, not corpora — they belong in
  the version-controlled tree alongside ADRs and specs.
- `findings/` (optional) — structured governance registers: `rfc-candidates.md`
  (candidate RFCs surfaced by owner-requested capture or `frame-situation`
  escalations) and `roadmap-intents.md` (deferred roadmap items). `rfc-status`
  surfaces the candidate count at session start.
- `initiatives/` (optional) — initiative brief artifacts and their
  `_template.md` seed. An initiative brief is the shaped output of the PE
  six-step sequence at altitude 1 (quarters, cross-repo scope); it links to
  the corresponding `workspace.toml` initiative section.
- `research/<slug>/` (optional) — committed desk-research project output:
  finding summaries, synthesis matrix, and analytic memos. Distinct from
  `findings/` (governance registers) and from personal-workspace scratch
  (gitignored ephemeral). Path configured via
  `agentbundle-layout.toml [research] output_dir` or elicited at
  `desk-research-project-start` time.

### 5c. `guides/` — for users

The user-facing documentation, organized by [Diátaxis](https://diataxis.fr/).
Four kinds of content, each serving a different reader need. **Mixing kinds
is the most common cause of bad docs.** The four kinds are:

- **tutorial** — *learning-oriented.* An on-rails lesson: one path, one
  guaranteed outcome, no detours.
- **how-to** — *task-oriented.* A recipe for a reader who has a specific
  named problem to solve.
- **reference** — *information-oriented.* Authoritative, dry, complete
  description of interfaces, config, commands.
- **explanation** — *understanding-oriented.* Why a design works the way
  it does, what concepts mean, how systems fit together.

**Each piece of content belongs in exactly one of these.** When a tutorial
wants to explain *why*, link out to an explanation page. When a how-to
wants to enumerate every option, link out to reference. The "link out"
discipline is the whole framework.

The four kinds are authoring contracts, not mandatory directory names.
How you organize the `guides/` tree is a local decision — by pack, by
topic, by quadrant, or flat. The contracts govern what each page promises
its reader regardless of where the file lives.

**Specs become user docs when features ship.** A shipped feature's spec
is the team's permanent record of the contract. Its *user-facing*
documentation lands in the appropriate `guides/` location (reference for
authoritative description, how-to if users need recipes, explanation if
it introduces a concept). The spec workflow is not done until those are
updated.

**Lifecycle for all three:** updated whenever the code or product changes
in a way that makes the description wrong. Keep them short — the goal is
to *orient* a reader, not to duplicate the code or the spec.

**Phase-slice doctrine applies here.** When a feature phase ships, its guides ship with it — not in a terminal documentation wave. A phase whose tooling is shipped but whose guides are absent is not a complete slice. See [§ Phase-slice planning](#phase-slice-planning) in *How we do non-trivial work*.

## Repository work intake and lifecycle index

Use `work-intake` as the front door for starting, remembering, inspecting, or
refreshing repository work. It classifies content by delivery role. Source
labels such as PRD, Feature, Story, Project, Issue, board, or Milestone are
hints; they do not select an intent, brief, spec, or defect route.

Canonical artifacts own requirements and decisions. `workspace.toml` is their
lifecycle index, not a second requirements store. A target entry contains
exactly `path`, `kind`, `source`, `summary`, and `needs`. Comments, summaries,
list order, tracker labels, and profile hints are non-semantic: they cannot
select a route, satisfy a dependency, choose a processor, or authorize
dispatch. Only an existing Approved `spec.md` with an existing sibling
`plan.md` and valid unique workspace membership may start from the queue.

Workspace prose stays terse and present-tense. A generated or materially
updated entry carries minimal provenance, one short summary of the current
outcome or next-needed condition, and hard dependencies only. It must not carry
history, rationale, procedure, review transcript, raw finding, copied source
text, soft priority, or suggested order in comments or adjacent fields. When
that context matters, write it to the resolved canonical artifact first and
index only the pointer. Settled live coordination is removed or compacted; it
is not replaced with a workspace history.

Repository-origin artifacts are locally authoritative. Tracker-origin
artifacts record source reference/revision and exactly one closed authority
record whose field map names `source` or `local` ownership. Intake acquisition
is read-only at the tracker boundary. Local refresh decisions and any supported
remote coordination action are separate effects; the latter needs its own
fresh exact confirmation.

Supported legacy workspace entries remain visible but non-dispatchable during
the compatibility window. Migration planning consumes a reviewed,
human-authored selection and remains read-only. Apply and rollback each consume
a fresh, single-use, human-authored confirmation permitted by repository
`[authorization.migration]` policy. Agents and migration tooling must never
create, edit, prefill, or choose substantive route or authorization values in
those files. Ledger-backed rollback restores the exact legacy workspace
representation and never deletes the canonical artifact.

`capture-work` is a temporary forwarding alias for `work-intake`; it must not
grow separate routing or storage semantics. New writers and workspace seeds
emit only target structured entries.

---

## Pack source-of-truth split

Bundle content (skills, agents, hooks, commands, hook-wiring, and pack
seeds) lives under `packs/<pack>/`. The split is:

- `packs/<pack>/.apm/` — the upstream for every adapter-projected
  primitive. Sub-directories: `skills/`, `agents/`, `hooks/`,
  `commands/`, `hook-wiring/`.
- `packs/<pack>/seeds/` — the upstream for every seed-projected path
  (the README / template / governance content adopters install).
  Files whose names start with `_` (e.g. `_agents-footer.md`) are
  *composition fragments* — they live in seeds for adopter
  customization but are not projected as standalone files; they're
  consumed by composite recipes.

*Projected* paths under `make build-check`'s gate:
- Adapter-driven primitives: the adapter's skills, agents, commands, and local
  settings targets; the adapter contract owns their exact paths. `tools/hooks/<name>.<ext>`
  and the `hooks` settings key are also adapter-driven.
- Adapter-independent runtime primitives: `.agentbundle/bin/<name>.py` from
  `packs/<pack>/.apm/adapter-root-bins/`, and
  `.agentbundle/lib/<module>/` from the package source vendored through
  `packs/<pack>/.apm/user-libs/`. These rails share the self-host drift gate
  even though they are outside every adapter's native discovery tree.
- Seed-projected paths: `docs/CONVENTIONS.md`. (Other seed-projected
  paths from earlier phases — `docs/CHARTER.md`, the seed READMEs
  under `docs/<area>/`, and `packages/_example/` — were reclassified
  as *Manual* with placeholder seeds; adopters receive the placeholder
  on first install via brownfield rules and own their on-disk content
  thereafter.)
- Aggregated: `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` from the `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`
  of every pack whose `[pack.install] allowed-scopes` admits `user` — and that declares `[pack.adapter-contract] version`; a pack with no
  contract version resolves `repo` regardless of what `allowed-scopes` says. The
  Claude-plugin route installs at user scope, so a repo-scoped pack is not
  listed there — it installs with `agentbundle install`.
- Recreated: `CLAUDE.md → AGENTS.md` symlink.

The pipeline regenerates each from its `packs/*/` upstream; direct
edits to any *Projected* path are caught by `make build-check` and
bounced with a message naming the source path and regeneration
command. The pack source-of-truth split is the catalogue's
load-bearing convention; CI's drift gate enforces it.

The muscle memory: to change a *Projected* path's content, edit its
upstream under `packs/<pack>/.apm/` or `packs/<pack>/seeds/`, then run
`make build-self` (with `FORCE=1` if the working tree is dirty),
commit, push. The gate is the contract; the source-of-truth split is
the convention.

### Managed generated output

A *managed* tree is one a compiler owns end to end: it writes every file in it,
records each one in a manifest beside the pack, and refuses to proceed if the
tree holds anything the manifest does not list. `compile-okf` is the current
example — it owns `.apm/skills/<router>/` and records it in
`.okf-generated.json`.

The rules:

- **Author the source, never the output.** Edit the canonical input (for OKF,
  `packs/<pack>/okf/<bundle>/`) and recompile. A hand edit to managed output is
  detected as drift, not accepted as a change.
- **A managed directory may not hold unmanaged files.** The compiler refuses a
  directory containing files its manifest does not own, because it cannot tell
  your file from a stale one it should delete. Keep hand-authored content in a
  sibling directory the compiler does not own.
- **Check mode is the gate; write mode is the authoring step.** Check re-renders
  and compares against the committed bytes, so it verifies without needing to
  write. That matters on platforms where the confined write path is
  unavailable — check mode still proves the committed output is what that
  platform produces.
- **Retargeting output is a rename, not a deletion.** Pointing a bundle at a new
  output directory hands the old one back to its author only when the source is
  still declared and its target actually changed. Removing a source is a
  removal, and its former output stays managed until cleaned up.

Managed output is projected like any other pack content, so the muscle memory
above still applies: edit the source, run `make build-self`, commit both.

### Install scope is per-pack

Each pack declares its install **scope** — `repo` (project-local), `user`
(shared across every repo the adopter opens), or both — in
`pack.toml`'s `[pack.install]` table. The pack author picks the
dimension; adopters can override within the publisher's declared set
via `--scope`. The default landing for every pack we ship today is
`repo`; user-scope eligibility requires content portability — no hooks
wired into a specific repo's surface, no seeds that name a particular
project. The schema enforces `default-scope ∈ allowed-scopes` so the
rule holds outside the CLI. `agentbundle install` re-runs the
contract-level user-scope rails (seeds / hooks / marker) against the
resolved pack content at install time, closing the
widen-after-publish gap.

## Commits

We use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

**Types:** `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `refactor`, `test`, `perf`, `build`, `ci`, `chore`.
**Scope:** the package or area touched (`packages/foo`, `docs`, `ci`).

**Footer references:** if the commit implements a spec, end with `Spec: docs/specs/<feature>/spec.md`. If it follows from an ADR or RFC, cite it the same way.

## Pull requests

A PR description should answer four questions in this order:

1. **What does this change?** (Plain English. Two sentences.)
2. **Why?** (Link to the spec, ADR, RFC, or issue.)
3. **How do I verify it?** (Specific commands, manual steps, or screenshots.)
4. **What did you not change that you considered?** (The dog that didn't bark.
   This catches more bugs than any other section.)

Size a PR as a reviewable semantic change, not as an agent session or a whole
specification. One specification may deliver one PR or a dependency-ordered
stack; each layer must be independently reviewable and leave the repository
working. Keep behavior with its related tests, separate refactoring from
behavior changes, and keep each curated commit independently testable.

Use 2,000 reviewable behavior and test lines only as a tail-triage trigger,
not as an automatic split rule. Classify by operational role, never file
extension: agent instruction files and executed content count as behavior.
Non-executable documentation prose is sized by coherence, not line count.
Report raw diff lines for triage, material volume after content-hash
deduplication, and reviewable behavior and test lines for size judgement.
Raw diff lines and changed-file count only prompt examination. Classify tail
shape by the median reviewable lines per changed, deduplicated file with at
least one such line; exclude prose, generated output, and duplicate copies.
WIDE is 60 or fewer, MIXED is above 60 and below 200, and DEEP is 200 or more.
If classification is ambiguous or contested, treat it as DEEP and decompose.

For mechanically uniform WIDE work, do not split: give the source artifact,
exact command, transformation invariant, zero diff on re-run, targeted tests,
sampled review, and rollback evidence.
For MIXED or DEEP work, split into dependency-ordered working layers. A single
coherent artifact is a floor: when it alone exceeds the trigger, nothing else
rides with it. The author names the single unit it serves and states why no
split preserves working layers. The same evidence is required for a regular
test suite serving one unit; otherwise decompose. An atomic correctness window
needs prior approver acceptance, a named invariant, volume classification,
validation evidence, and a rollback path; a breaking interface change is not
grounds and uses expand/migrate/contract.

Bundled fixes must be listed under `Bundled fixes:` and fail closed on design
calls or behavior changes. Tier 1 is reproducible: state the command and show
a zero diff on re-run; it may span the repository. Tier 2 is provably inert:
show no remaining references and green tests for bounded dead-code or
unused-import removal. Tier 3 is hand-made: same-area, same-concern, visibly
smaller mechanical work. Tier 1 and Tier 2 require their command or evidence.

CI must be green. Specs must match implementation. A released-artifact version
bump carries its changelog entry (see *`docs/product/` — for maintainers*); if
the repository publishes packages separately, each also updates its own
`CHANGELOG.md`.

## How we do non-trivial work

Skip the loop only when a change is cosmetic, tightly local, behavior-preserving,
*and* obviously verifiable — a one-line authentication, migration, production-
config, or public-interface change is not trivial. For everything else, follow
the **plan → execute → verify → review → iterate** loop. The mechanics are in
the `work-loop` skill; this section is the why.

**Why a loop, not a single pass.** LLM self-assessment is unreliable: agents
declare victory when they *feel* done. Mechanical gates (lint, typecheck,
tests) plus an adversarial review pass replace "feel" with verifiable
termination. The loop keeps going until both kinds of check are satisfied —
or it pauses for human replanning.

Before construction, a caller may use `shaping-reviewer` to test a contract's
scope and observability. That is distinct from the later code-review lenses:
adversarial review checks delivery drift, security review checks threats, and
quality review checks maintainability.

**Why think before acting.** The cost of a wrong start is higher than the
cost of thinking. For high-stakes changes (architectural choices, multi-file
refactors, anything touching shared infrastructure), use your agent's
extended-thinking facility — it catches the wrong assumption *before* it
becomes 14 commits of wrong code. For routine work, skip the ceremony; the
discipline is "match thinking depth to stakes," not "always think hardest."

**Why iterate, not retry-from-scratch.** Most loops converge: gates fail,
review surfaces a finding, the next pass fixes it. Restart-from-scratch
loses the planning context. We do it the other way only when fresh context
is the *point* — an unattended, fresh-session-per-iteration loop (see the
work-loop skill).

**Why a hard iteration cap.** Without one, you're hoping. The implementation and review retry caps live as data in `state.json` (see below) and are enforced by the `work-loop` skill's `scripts/loop-cohort.py` through `loop-cohort check --phase gates-failed` and `--phase review`; if you hit one, the task is bigger than you thought — pause for human replanning, then stop, re-plan, or split. A cap never declares the accepted intent complete or creates follow-on work automatically.

**Why capture learnings.** A loop that finishes without updating *some*
doc, skill, or note has wasted what it learned. The next agent (or a
human) will pay for it again. The work-loop skill enumerates where each
kind of learning belongs.

### Intent-scoped completion

Completion answers to the original accepted intent, not to the current pull
request. A pull request is a review unit: one accepted intent may need more
than one independently reviewed unit in the same session. Only the owner may
narrow or waive that intent.

For every implementation or review discovery, determine intent fit before the
session decision:

| Intent fit | Session decision | Disposition |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Matches | Include now | Add it to the current plan or session. |
| Matches | Do not include | Stop incomplete unless the owner explicitly narrows or waives the intent. |
| Does not match | Include now | Obtain an explicit scope change; it then becomes accepted intent. |
| Does not match | Do not include | Exclude it with no durable follow-on by default. |
| Unclear | — | Ask the owner before acting. |

An included discovery shares the current review unit only when the accepted
contract authorizes it and it qualifies under the bundled-fixes tiers. A
distinct design, behavior, or semantic change becomes the next review unit in
the same session. An excluded discovery is acknowledged by the PR's *What did
you not change that you considered?* answer; create a durable follow-on only
when the owner explicitly requests capture, then route it through `work-intake`.
Retry caps and review stasis pause for human replanning; they neither complete
the accepted intent nor create backlog work automatically.

### Light and full modes

**Rigor scales with risk, not file count.** An eligible light request runs
directly from the current session without a persisted spec; durable or
risk-triggering work uses the spec-and-plan path. The `work-loop` skill is the
single owner of mode mechanics and the enumerated trigger set.

**Why risk, not file count.** A familiar two-file change is cheap to get right
and cheap to undo; a one-file change to an auth path or a published interface is
neither. Each trigger maps to a gate the repo already maintains, so the set is
the boundary's exhaustiveness argument. The mechanics of what light mode trims
and how full mode runs live in the `work-loop` skill.

### Two front doors

Work enters this loop through one of two front doors, depending on whether the
repo already exists:

- **Greenfield — a brand-new repo from an idea.** The `init-project` skill is
  the front door. It runs a trigger gate (throwaways and one-off scripts skip
  the flow), a value gate over fed-in discovery, records a foundation (an ADR
  plus `docs/architecture/reference.md`), authors a walking-skeleton spec via
  `new-spec`, and hands the build to `work-loop`.
- **Brownfield — an existing repo.** The `adapt-to-project` skill is the front
  door, run after installing a pack to fit the conventions to what's already
  there — including harvesting a `reference.md` from the existing code.

Both converge on the same downstream loop: `brief → reference.md → spec →
low-level design → work-loop`. Neither is mandatory ceremony — the greenfield
trigger gate sends a throwaway straight to scaffolding, and a small change in an
existing repo just opens a PR.

### Phase-slice planning

Each journey phase ships its capability and its guide together. A phase whose tooling ships without its guide is not a complete slice — the guide is part of what makes the capability independently usable. Deferring all guides to a terminal documentation wave is an anti-pattern: it accumulates authoring debt, makes earlier phases incompletely documented, and often results in guides that are never written.

**What counts as a guide for a phase:** a Diátaxis artifact in `guides/` (see *§ 5c. guides/*) that covers the capability the phase introduces. The guide need not be comprehensive — it should orient the user to the capability and link to the reference for the rest.

**Enforcement:** the `author-delivery-brief` skill extends the shippability test to include guides; the `new-rfc` skill requires that when an RFC covers multiple phases, each phase's guides ship with that phase — not in a terminal wave.

### Work-loop state

The work-loop's `state.json` schema, exit contract, lifecycle, and
atomic-write discipline live with the skill that consumes them —
see `references/state-schema.md` in the `work-loop` skill.
The template at `assets/state.json` in the `work-loop` skill
is the starting point `loop-cohort init` copies in. Every state mutation
(init, plan-approval, fingerprint rotation, worktree coordination) is
owned by the `loop-cohort` tool;
SKILL prose calls each verb at the appropriate phase rather than
mutating JSON by hand.

### Model selection

Every subagent file declares `model:` in its frontmatter explicitly. The
`agentbundle catalogue verify` (step 11, `_step_agent_artifacts`) linter
enforces this. Reasoning behind each current choice:

| Subagent | Model | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `adversarial-reviewer` | `opus` | Adversarial judgment; stakes are correctness. Output drives a hard gate. |
| `security-reviewer` | `opus` | Threat-model reasoning; stakes are security. |
| `quality-engineer` | `opus` | Maintenance lens; spec-level coverage pass. Reconsider per observation. |
| `implementer` | `sonnet` | One narrow plan task per dispatch; gates rerun in the primary; supervisor judges merge readiness. Cost beats capability here. |
| `finding-adjudicator` | `opus` | Weighs a reviewer's claim against repository evidence and decides what the loop may act on. A wrong refutation silently discards a real defect, so this is judgment under conflict, not extraction. |

Changing a subagent's model is a behaviour change, not a configuration
tweak — note the change in the PR that makes it, with a one-line
justification. If the change is reversing a previous choice in a way a
future maintainer would ask "why", surface it in the PR description.

### Supervisor mode

**Supervisor mode is wave-scheduled and sequential in Phase 1.** The
work-loop builds the plan's full `Depends on:` DAG
(`loop-cohort schedule`) and runs tasks in topological order, single-agent,
on every adapter — failing loud on a cycle and warning on a
forward-reference. Parallel `implementer` fan-out (`dispatch-decision`, `worktree`, `auto-parallel`) is **disabled in Phase 1** — those verbs exit non-zero without touching `state.json`. The design intent for opt-in parallel fan-out and the step-by-step worktree procedure live in the `work-loop` skill §EXECUTE and `references/supervisor-mode.md`. This section is the why and the boundary.

**Why a separate mode instead of a separate skill.** The trigger is
structural (the plan's shape), not a choice the user makes. Branching
inside `work-loop` means contributors never pick the wrong skill, and
the 80% overlap with single-agent flow stays single-sourced.

**Why an implementer subagent, not a recursive work-loop.** The
implementer's job is narrow — build one task, run gates, report.
Reviewing, dispatch decisions, and merge belong to the supervisor. A
recursive work-loop would let an implementer spawn its own
implementers; that's nested coordination overhead with no clear win.
Keep the tree two levels deep: supervisor → leaf implementers.

**Worktrees as the coordination primitive.** Each independent task gets
`.worktrees/<task-id>/` checked out on its own branch
(`<base-branch>-<task-id>`). Worktrees are git-native, support parallel
checkout of the same repo, and avoid lockfile contention. The directory
is gitignored ([`.gitignore`](../.gitignore)); branches live in git
history for traceability.

**Merge discipline.** The supervisor merges with `git merge --no-ff
<base>-<task-id>` into the primary branch, **sequentially in task-id
order**. The procedure file
(`references/supervisor-mode.md` in the `work-loop` skill)
has the executable form (including how to order non-numeric IDs). If a
sequential merge conflicts, the tasks weren't actually independent —
the plan was wrong. Surface that as a PLAN-level escalation, not a
`git mergetool` session.

**Gates run in the primary, not the worktree.** Each implementer runs
gates inside its worktree and reports the result, but those results are
**advisory**. The supervisor reruns lint / typecheck / tests against
the merged state — that's the only signal that counts.

**Escalating implementer failures.** If an implementer reports
`blocked` or `failed`, the supervisor surfaces the failure list to a
human and returns to PLAN. It does **not** redispatch the same
implementer on the same task — the assumption that produced the
failure is what needs revising, not the attempt.

**Known limitation.** The procedure has been validated by prose
walk-through, not by an executed end-to-end dry-run. Any change to
**pre-flight (procedure step 0)**, **worktree creation (step 1)**,
**report persistence ordering (step 3)**, **merge order (step 5)**,
**cleanup recovery (step 6)**, or the **`state.json` `worktrees`
schema** must perform an actual `git worktree add` + parallel-dispatch
round against a throwaway spec before merging — read-only walk-through
is not sufficient for those surfaces. Step numbers refer to the
procedure at `references/supervisor-mode.md` in the `work-loop` skill.

### Knowledge base

The repo accumulates practitioner-level lessons in
`docs/knowledge/patterns.jsonl`: patterns ("when you touch X, also
remember Y"), gotchas ("the auth middleware caches tokens for 15
minutes"), and antipatterns ("don't mock the database in integration
tests"). One JSON object per line, scoped to a file glob. The schema
and curation conventions live in
[`docs/knowledge/README.md`](knowledge/README.md).

**Why a separate bucket.** ADRs answer *why we decided X*;
`architecture/` describes *current structure*; `guides/` is for
*users*. Knowledge entries are practitioner residue — the things you
learn by building, not by deciding or documenting. They earn a home
because they're scoped to globs (a deliberate retrieval for `packages/auth`
should return the auth gotchas, not every lesson the repo ever learned)
and kept current (edit or remove entries as the codebase changes —
git history is the record; see `docs/knowledge/README.md § Curation`).

**How agents see it.** The normal session-start hook does not load the file into
model context. An operator can explicitly invoke
`tools/hooks/session-start.py --show-knowledge`, optionally filtered by a path
or narrower glob, for curation. Matching uses Python's `fnmatch` with the
caller's `--scope` value as the *path* argument and the entry's
stored glob as the *pattern*, so an agent working in
`packages/auth/server.ts` gets entries scoped to `packages/auth/**`
plus any repo-wide `*` entries. The work-loop SKILL's
*Capture what was learned*
section points contributors at this file as the destination for
pattern/gotcha/antipattern-shaped learnings; other shapes still go
where they already belong (AGENTS.md, skill bodies, architecture/).

### Enforcement

Two layered mechanisms enforce discipline before a PR opens:

| Layer | Mechanism | What it gates |
|---|---|---|
| Caps | `scripts/loop-cohort.py check` in the `work-loop` skill | Implementation retry cap (`--phase gates-failed`) and review retry cap (`--phase review`) (see `references/state-schema.md` in the `work-loop` skill). The same tool owns every state mutation upstream of the check. |
| Your gate | `tools/hooks/pre-pr.py` | Runs the caps check, then **your project's own** lint / typecheck / test commands — wire them into the stub in `pre-pr.py` (or let the `adapt-to-project` skill fill them in from your detected build commands). |

This is **Shift Left**: catch problems as early as possible, locally
before CI, at PLAN before EXECUTE. The pre-EXECUTE adversarial review
in the work-loop skill is the same pattern at a different layer —
moving review left from after code is written to before it is.

`session-start.py` is shipped pre-wired by the install pipeline: the
SessionStart binding lands in the adapter's local settings file
automatically, no manual paste. `pre-pr.py` stays consumer-wired,
because Claude Code has no PR-open lifecycle event (`Stop` fires after
every agent turn — wrong semantics). Wire `pre-pr.py` via
`.git/hooks/pre-push` if you want it automatic, or run it by hand
before opening a PR.

### When to reach for an unattended loop

The same loop can run unattended — a fresh agent session per iteration,
state in files only. Some agents ship a native mode for this. Use it when
*all* of these hold: completion is mechanical, work slices into
context-window-sized items, verification is reliable, and you've already
validated the approach in-session. It's a sharp tool — useful, narrow, and
not the answer to most work; the work-loop skill covers when it fits.



Skills are workflows agents invoke for repeating tasks: scaffolding a package,
opening an ADR, running a release. They live in the adapter's skills directory as
`<name>/SKILL.md`.

Add a skill when you've done the same multi-step thing three times. Don't add
one speculatively — speculative skills bloat context and degrade adherence.

The skill index is generated at the bottom of `AGENTS.md`.

## Scaling profiles — how this template adapts to different repo sizes

This template is designed for **single applications, components,
microservices, and medium-sized platforms or engines** — repos with
roughly 1 to 50 contributors. It is **not** designed for sprawling
monorepos with hundreds of contributors and SIG-style governance; if
that's your context, look at Kubernetes' or CNCF's models instead.

The structure stays the same at every supported size. What changes is
which folders you actively populate and how much ceremony each kind of
doc carries. **An empty folder is not a problem** — it's a placeholder
for content that will arrive when it's needed.

### Profile A — Microservice / single component (1-3 contributors)

The minimum viable set. Many of the template's folders sit empty until
something forces them to fill.

| Keep | Delete or leave empty |
| --- | --- |
| `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md` (symlink) | `packages/`, `apps/` (no monorepo split) |
| `docs/CHARTER.md` (a few lines is fine) | `rfc/` (almost never fires at this size) |
| `docs/CONVENTIONS.md` (trim aggressively) | `docs/architecture/` (the README is enough) |
| `docs/adr/` (write when you make a real tradeoff) | `docs/product/personas.md` |
| `docs/specs/` (one spec at a time, or none) | Per-package `AGENTS.md` (no packages) |
| `docs/product/changelog.md` | the `adversarial-reviewer` subagent (overhead at this size) |
| `guides/reference/` (API/config docs) | Other Diátaxis buckets — fill as needed |
| the `work-loop` skill | |

**Rule of thumb:** if your README + an OpenAPI/schema file would have
been enough, you're at this profile. The template gives you ADRs and
specs *for when* a decision or feature gets non-trivial — not as
mandatory ceremony.

### Profile B — Single library or app (4-10 contributors)

Most folders start carrying content.

- All of Profile A, plus:
- `docs/architecture/overview.md` becomes useful (one file).
- `docs/specs/` typically has 1-3 active features at a time.
- `guides/` grows: at least `reference/` and probably one
  `tutorials/` entry (a quickstart) and a few `how-to/` recipes.
- ADRs accumulate slowly — maybe 5-15 over the project's first year.
- `rfc/` may still be unused; PRs are enough for most decisions.
- `adversarial-reviewer` subagent is worth using. `security-reviewer` and
  `quality-engineer` are worth reaching for when a PR warrants them — see
  the `work-loop` skill's REVIEW step.

### Profile C — Medium platform / engine (10-50 contributors)

This is the design target — everything in the template is in active use.

- All of Profile B, plus:
- `apps/` and/or `packages/` populated, each with its own `AGENTS.md`.
- `rfc/` actively used for cross-cutting changes.
- `docs/architecture/` contains an overview plus per-subsystem files.
- `guides/` has substantive content in all four Diátaxis buckets.
- `docs/product/roadmap.md` reviewed quarterly with real stakes.
- ADRs are routine — likely 30+ in the project's history.
- Multiple specs in flight; spec/plan/review discipline carries weight.

### Multi-agent shape by profile

The mechanisms — supervisor mode, parallel reviewer dispatch, the
knowledge base — are defined in their own sections above. The mapping
below says *which of them you actually use* at each profile, so a
template adopter knows when to wire each one up.

- **Profile A** — single-agent work-loop. Supervisor mode is available
  but rarely triggers; most plans at this size have sequential
  `Depends on:` chains, and the parallel-dispatch payoff doesn't beat
  the coordination overhead. Specialist reviewers are usually skipped,
  and `adversarial-reviewer` itself is optional at this size.
- **Profile B** — [supervisor mode](#supervisor-mode) runs every
  multi-task plan in topological order (sequential by default); its
  parallel-write fan-out earns its keep only when a wave of independent
  tasks clears the safe-category ∧ `git merge-tree` gate. Reviewer
  fan-out follows the
  *Parallel dispatch discipline* section
  in the work-loop skill: one tool-call message, one Agent use per
  reviewer, barrier-wait, merge in the orchestrator's context.
- **Profile C** — same as B, plus the [knowledge base](#knowledge-base)
  is actively populated (`docs/knowledge/patterns.jsonl`). The
  `session-start` hook is shipped pre-wired by the install pipeline,
  but knowledge remains out of automatic session context; explicit
  `--show-knowledge` rendering is available for curation.

### Above Profile C

If your repo is heading past ~50 active contributors with multiple teams
working in parallel, the template starts to underspecify what you need.
At that scale you typically need:

- A `GOVERNANCE.md` describing roles, decision processes, and how
  authority is granted.
- A formal RFC process with comment periods and final-comment-period
  rules (Rust's [RFC process](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs) is the
  reference).
- Sub-team boundaries (CNCF SIGs, Kubernetes-style).
- CODEOWNERS-driven review routing.

Adopt those when the friction of *not* having them exceeds the friction
of adopting them — not as a precaution.

### Anti-patterns at every size

- **Bootstrapping at Profile C when you're at Profile A.** Empty
  ceremony degrades into ignored ceremony. Start at the right profile
  and grow into the next one when you actually need it.
- **Skipping Profile A entirely because "we'll be a platform someday."**
  You'll get there faster if early decisions are recorded honestly than
  if they're hidden inside a structure too big for the team to maintain.

## Common rationalizations

These are rationalizations to refuse, whether they arise before the work-loop
loads or while it is running.

| The lie | The rebuttal |
| --- | --- |
| "We'll update the spec after the PR." | Spec drift is a bug, not follow-up work — update spec and code in the same PR. See [`AGENTS.md` § Development workflow](../AGENTS.md#development-workflow) and the spec lifecycle rule in § 4 above. |
| "I'll verify this manually, just this once." | Verification mode — TDD, goal-based, or manual QA — is declared in the plan task, not improvised at the keyboard. If manual QA is the right mode, write it down; if it isn't, pick TDD or a goal-based check. See the PLAN phase in the `work-loop` skill. |
| "I can fix this while I'm here." | Out-of-scope changes need a separate PR or an explicit note in the plan. Scope creep is the most common cause of failed adversarial review. See [`AGENTS.md` § Development workflow](../AGENTS.md#development-workflow). |
| "This decision doesn't need an ADR — it's obvious." | If you're making it, it isn't obvious to the next person. Writing an ADR now costs less than someone re-litigating the decision in six months. See § 2 above and the `new-adr` skill. |
| "Low-risk, so I'll skip the work-loop." | Load `work-loop` and write its trio anyway — light mode is lean, not absent. The discipline is the point, not the length. |
| "I don't need a spec, I understand the task." | An eligible direct-light request keeps its plan in the active session; it does not persist a spec. If the work needs durability or any risk trigger fires, use `new-spec` for the durable spec and plan. |
| "I'll grep the codebase as I go." | Verify APIs before you start writing, not while you're writing. |
| "I'll match the surrounding code's pattern." | Check the root `AGENTS.md` guidance first; local style may already conflict with the repository's documented convention. |

## Credentialed skills

Skills that call external authenticated APIs follow a tighter set of
rules than plain skills, because the moment a credential reaches the
LLM as a tool argument the architecture has already failed.
This section is the in-loop reminder of the shape every credentialed
skill must respect.

### Two-layer architecture

Skills do not hold credentials. A *credentialed primitive* — a Python
module, an MCP server, or a CLI wrapper packaged as a primitive —
owns the secret on disk and constructs the API call inside its own
process. The skill body invokes the primitive without ever touching
the token. A how-to on adding a credentialed skill walks authors
through broker selection and the verbatim security-rules blocks; the
shipped `jira` / `figma` skills are runnable references.

### Frontmatter declarations

A credentialed skill declares three project-specific flags under the
`metadata:` block of its `SKILL.md` frontmatter:

```yaml
---
name: your-skill-name
description: <what triggers it>
metadata:
  credentialed: true
  primitive-class: credentialed-cli   # or mcp-server
  auth: creds                         # env / cli / creds / sso-cookie
  # auth-fallback: creds              # optional: dual-auth — the broker to fall
  #                                   #   back to when the active one can't resolve
  #                                   #   (e.g. sso-cookie with a creds fallback)
  # broker-specific extras follow:
  # namespace: <ns>                   # required for auth: creds and auth: env
  # keys: ["<KEY>"]                   # required for auth: creds and auth: env
  # sso_profile: <profile>            # required for auth: sso-cookie
---
```

The keys live under `metadata:` rather than at top level because the
[agentskills.io specification](https://agentskills.io/specification)
pins the top-level frontmatter set to `name`, `description`,
`license`, `compatibility`, `metadata`, `allowed-tools` and reserves
`metadata:` as the project-specific escape hatch. `agentbundle catalogue verify`
(step 11) refuses any top-level key outside that set; `agentbundle catalogue lint`
(`_PackRules._check_credentialed_skills`) scopes its checks to skills with `metadata.credentialed: true`.

`metadata.auth-fallback` is optional and names a second broker a **dual-auth**
skill falls back to when the active one can't resolve (e.g. an `auth: sso-cookie`
skill that drops to `creds` on a non-SSO instance). When present, the skill's
Security section must satisfy **both** brokers' don't-block phrase sets.

### Four brokers — pick one per skill

`metadata.auth` names the broker that resolves the credential. Choose
exactly one of these four ids:

- **`env`** — the credential is a plain environment variable
  (`<NAMESPACE>_<KEY>`). Catalogue contributes naming convention and
  lint; no runtime resolver.
- **`cli`** — the primitive shells out to a vendor-authenticated
  binary (`gh`, `aws`, `kubectl`, `gcloud`). Vendor CLI owns the
  credential.
- **`creds`** — static token via the three-tier model (env → OS
  keychain → 0600 dotfile floor). Resolved via the `credbroker`
  library (`pip install credbroker`), imported in-process; the
  build-projected `credentials_shim` it replaced is retired for
  `creds` consumers (the four-broker taxonomy above is unchanged).
- **`sso-cookie`** — session cookie acquired via a headed-browser SSO
  flow. The skill resolves the session through the `credbroker` SSO
  resolver (`from credbroker import load_sso_cookies`), which
  subprocess-invokes `~/.agentbundle/bin/sso-broker.py` (projected by the
  `credential-brokers` pack at user scope) — mirroring how `creds` moved
  broker resolution into `credbroker`. A skill that still resolves the
  broker in its own `scripts/` is also accepted.

The broker-agnostic invariants below apply to every credentialed
primitive regardless of broker. Broker-specific lint extensions layer
on top (`auth: creds` requires a credential-resolver import in
`scripts/` — `from credbroker import …`, or the legacy
`from .credentials_shim …`; `auth: env` requires each declared `<NAMESPACE>_<KEY>` to
be read at least once; `auth: sso-cookie` requires either a credbroker SSO import
(`from credbroker import load_sso_cookies`) or subprocess-invocation of the
canonical `Path.home() / ".agentbundle" / "bin" / "sso-broker.py"` path; `auth:
cli` falls through to broker-agnostic checks only).

### Three storage tiers

Credentials resolve in this order, first-hit-wins per key:

1. **Tier 1 — env var.** `<NAMESPACE>_<KEY>` from `os.environ`
   (e.g. `JIRA_API_TOKEN`). Composes with Vault Agent / `op run --`
   wrappers without further changes; the only path that does.
2. **Tier 2 — OS keyring.** macOS Keychain via `/usr/bin/security`
   (token via child stdin, never argv); Windows Credential Manager
   via in-process `ctypes` against `advapi32`. Linux falls through
   to Tier 3 in v1 — a `libsecret` backend is deferred to a v2 RFC.
3. **Tier 3 — dotfile.** `~/.agentbundle/credentials.env`, mode
   `0600` on POSIX, DACL-verified via `icacls` on Windows. The
   fallback floor.

Changing the order, or adding a new tier, is an `Ask first` action
in the spec's Boundaries section — the corporate-network constraints
that justified the precedence are non-obvious.

### The argv ban

Credentialed-CLI-class primitives must refuse the value-shaped flags
`--token`, `--api-token`, `--api-key`, `--bearer`, `--pat`,
`--password`. The CLI verb's `setup` subparser registers these as
*tombstone arguments* whose action emits the verbatim sentinel
`tokens cannot be passed via argv` and exits non-zero; the
`agentbundle catalogue lint` (`_PackRules._check_credentialed_skills`) refuses any primitive's
script that declares one of the banned names in an
`argparse.ArgumentParser.add_argument` call. MCP-server-class
primitives may accept *header-naming* flags (`--bearer-header`,
`--auth-header`, `--header-prefix`) because those name *which* header
to consult per-request, not the value.

### Anti-pattern register

Five anti-patterns rejected by name:

- **Tokens in skill argv** — defeats the architecture rule.
- **A `get` verb that returns a cleartext token** — any verb that
  prints the resolved token to stdout enables capture from a skill
  body. The `credential-setup` skill writes; a consumer's `check`
  verb reads (resolves and returns 0/non-0 only); no skill or shim
  surface returns the cleartext token to a caller other than the
  in-process credentialed primitive that owns the API call.
- **Per-skill dotfiles** — the contract mandates one well-known per-user
  file; per-skill files multiply the wipe-on-rotation surface.
- **`SSL_VERIFY=false` defaults** — `--insecure` is opt-in only and
  must emit a stderr warning.
- **Vendored copies of third-party API skills** — pin upstream and
  audit; do not fork to silence a vendor's lint.

### Corporate-network requirements

Credentialed primitives ship from this catalogue running on corporate
laptops; the network they live on imposes constraints the primitive
must respect:

- **Honor `HTTPS_PROXY` / `NO_PROXY` from the environment.** No
  hard-coded `requests.get(...)` without proxy resolution.
- **Honor the system trust store via `REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE`,
  `SSL_CERT_FILE`, `SSL_CERT_DIR`.** Corporate MITM CAs land here;
  ignoring them turns into a "works on the engineer's laptop only"
  bug.
- **Refuse `--insecure` / `verify=False` as a default.** Opt-in flag
  only; primitive emits a stderr warning whenever it fires.

---

## Privacy

**Never commit personal information to any file in this repo.** This includes:

- Real names, email addresses, usernames, or account identifiers.
- Org-specific domains, subdomains, or employer hostnames.
- AAD/UUID identifiers tied to real people.
- Device names, profile paths, or user-specific filesystem paths.
- Names of personal service providers or platforms that identify account relationships.

Use generic placeholders everywhere: `user@example.com`, `colleague@example.com`, `Example User`,
`https://mail.yourorg.com/`, `aaaaaaaa-bbbb-cccc-dddd-eeeeeeeeeeee`, `example-service`,
and `[service type]`.

**This rule covers all git artifacts** — code, comments, docs, specs, commit messages,
PR titles, PR bodies, and PR comments are permanent record. Never use real service or
vendor names as examples; use `example-service` or `[service type]` instead. When
authoring governance docs (ADRs, RFCs, specs), GitHub handles used for author/decider
fields are not PII — they are public project identifiers.
Do not infer them from session context.

## When this file is wrong

If a convention here is causing friction, **say so in an RFC**. Don't quietly
deviate. The whole point of writing this down is that the rules are visible and
contestable.
