## [cognito-auth-chatbot][0.1.0] — 2026-09-01

### Added

- Cognito Hosted UI login gates the chat app; pre-provisioned users only, no self-service sign-up.
- Chat screen: send a message, get a rule-based reply from a Lambda-backed API. Chat history is not saved across sessions.
- Sign-out control that immediately ends the session.
