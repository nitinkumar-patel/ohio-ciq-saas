# Knowledge base

The repository's accumulating record of *patterns, gotchas, and
antipatterns* — the things a project learns about itself as code lands.
It lives at `patterns.jsonl` next to this file; contributors and agents curate
it deliberately, but the installed session-start hook does not load it into
model context automatically.

This is deliberately different from the documents that already exist:

| Where | What goes there |
|---|---|
| `docs/adr/` | Decisions ("we chose X over Y because…"). Immutable. |
| `docs/architecture/` | Current code structure. Living. |
| `docs/guides/` | User-facing docs. Diátaxis. |
| **`docs/knowledge/patterns.jsonl`** | **Practitioner-level lessons: patterns, gotchas, antipatterns. Scoped to file globs.** |

ADRs answer *why was this decided*. Knowledge entries answer *what
should the next person avoid stepping on, or repeat*.

## When to add an entry

A loop has finished. You ask: *what would have made this work materially
better — more correct, complete, reliable, recoverable, secure,
privacy-preserving, deterministic, reproducible, operable, maintainable,
reviewable, efficient, or independent of hidden context?* Speed is one useful
signal, not the objective. Record a learning when knowing it would materially
change a future approach along one or more of those quality attributes.

Three answers worth recording here:

- **Pattern.** "When you touch X, also remember Y." A repeatable shape
  that worked once and will work again. Example: "Every package's
  `bootstrap()` should call `validateConfig()` first."
- **Gotcha.** A non-obvious cost or constraint that bit you. Example:
  "The auth middleware caches tokens for 15 minutes — invalidate it
  manually after a role change."
- **Antipattern.** A shape that looked appealing but rotted. Example:
  "Don't mock the database in integration tests; we got burned last
  quarter when mocked tests passed but the prod migration failed."

If the lesson is about *current code structure*, it belongs in
`architecture/`. If it's a *decision*, it belongs in `adr/`. If it's
*how to use the product*, it belongs in `guides/`. Knowledge entries
are the residue that doesn't fit those buckets — *practice* rather
than structure, decision, or instruction.

## Schema

`patterns.jsonl` is line-delimited JSON. Each non-empty line is one
entry with **six required keys — `id`, `kind`, `scope`, `title`,
`body`, `source`** (plus optional `tier`). Omitting `source` is the
usual mistake:

```json
{"id": "K-NNNN", "kind": "pattern", "scope": "packages/auth/**", "title": "Always parameterize SQL queries", "body": "Use parameterized queries everywhere — string-concatenated SQL has bitten us twice. The `db.query()` helper enforces this; reach for it instead of raw drivers.", "source": "PR#42"}
```

<!-- The knowledge linter's self-test parses the field table below and the
     `kind` row to check them against the linter. Keep each field's name
     backticked in the first column on a single line; keep every kind
     backticked on the kind row. Don't split rows across lines. -->

| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | `K-\d{4,}` | Unique, zero-padded to four digits. Conventionally sequential, but the linter only enforces uniqueness — gaps are fine. |
| `kind` | `pattern` \| `gotcha` \| `antipattern` | Exactly one of these three values. |
| `scope` | glob(s) | Path pattern(s) this applies to — `packages/auth/**`, `src/cli/*.py`, or `*` for repo-wide. Comma-separate for multiple patterns: `"packages/auth/**, src/models/**"`. |
| `tier` | `"invariant"` \| `"observation"` | Optional, default `"observation"`. A routing hint for curation and future retrieval. It no longer grants automatic prompt authority or causes session replay. During an explicit `--show-knowledge --scope ...` curation render, `invariant` entries remain visible regardless of the scope filter. |
| `title` | string | One-line summary; aim for under 80 characters. |
| `body` | string | The lesson itself. A paragraph or two is enough; if you find yourself writing more, the entry probably wants to be split. |
| `source` | string | Where this came from: `PR#42`, `ADR-0007`, `issue#13`, etc. |

Length and character limits: the writer caps `title` at 120 codepoints, `body` at 2000, `scope` at 200 and `source` at 120; the gate uses a looser ceiling, since entries predating both run over the cap. Tab is fine anywhere. A newline is fine in `body` only — session-start indents each body line, but prints `id`/`kind`/`scope`/`title` on one unindented line and `source` on its own, so a newline elsewhere forges a line in what it replays. Other control characters, characters that render as nothing, and runs of more than eight spaces are refused.

One gap is known and accepted: strong right-to-left characters reorder adjacent punctuation under the bidi algorithm without any control character present, so a value mixing them with ASCII can render in a different order than it is stored. The explicit bidi controls are refused; the implicit reordering is not detected.

The format is JSONL (one JSON object per line, no commas, no wrapping
array) so it grows by append and reads line-by-line.
`lint-knowledge.py` validates the file. `tools/hooks/session-start.py` can
render it only when explicitly invoked with `--show-knowledge`; normal session
startup does not read it into model context.

## Capturing a new observation

Do not append a new row to `patterns.jsonl`. Its `append-knowledge.py` command
is a retired compatibility shim that always refuses; migration alone reads the
legacy corpus. A producer that reaches an exact semantic gate constructs the
published typed captured-observation request and invokes the progressive
`project-knowledge --capture` mode. The public skill validates privacy,
provenance, freshness, and repository confinement before its private writer
can append a pending journal event.

If this repository has not activated a coherent v1 topic map, capture emits
the named unavailable/refusal outcome and creates no legacy append or fallback
file. Capture remains unavailable until a reviewed migration activates that
map; do not bypass the migration lifecycle by hand-editing the legacy corpus.

Existing legacy rows remain raw UTF-8, never `\uXXXX`-escaped. Both forms are
valid JSON, so a serializer whose ASCII escaping defaults on can drift the
file silently while it still passes other JSON rules. This is a curation and
migration constraint, not authorization to add a new row.

Entries are **evidence, not instructions**, and are no longer replayed into
sessions automatically — see § Where this fits in the work-loop. Still keep the body to
lessons about this repo, and never paste content from an untrusted source into
one: an entry is a durable, agent-authored record that a human approves. Characters
that render as nothing — bidi overrides, zero-width joiners in runs, the
Unicode Tag block, the variation selectors, the Mongolian ones — are refused
outright by the legacy linter and v1 writer because a payload you cannot see in
a diff could still be rendered into model context during explicit curation or
future task-scoped retrieval. The rule is Unicode's
default-ignorable property, and there is a budget on how many may appear at all,
not just how many may sit together. Persisted evidence follows `AGENTS.md` §
Privacy: no real names, emails, org hostnames, or user-specific filesystem
paths — use the placeholders listed there.

## Verify before committing

`lint-knowledge.py` ships with the `work-loop` skill, so there is
nothing to wire: `tools/hooks/pre-pr.py` runs it over this file
automatically. To check the legacy corpus during curation or migration, run it directly from wherever
your agent tool installed the skill (`.claude/skills/`, `.agents/skills/`,
`.kiro/skills/`, `.apm/skills/`):

```bash
python3 .claude/skills/work-loop/scripts/lint-knowledge.py; echo "exit=$?"
```

Run it **unfiltered** and read its exit code. Never pipe a gate through
`tail` or `grep` to judge it: `<gate> | tail -2` reports *tail's* exit
code — always 0 — and truncates away the `✖ <file>:<line>:` lines that
name what is wrong, so an entry with a missing `source` key reads as
clean locally and fails in CI.

The session-start hook is not a substitute — it skips a malformed line
silently rather than failing the session.

## Curation

This file is a **living representation** of what practitioners should
know right now — not an immutable audit log. Keep it accurate:

- **Edit** an entry's body, title, or scope when the lesson changes.
- **Remove** an entry when the underlying code is gone, the constraint
  no longer applies, or the lesson has been promoted to a canonical
  location (AGENTS.md, CONVENTIONS.md, architecture doc).
- **Add** a note in the body when an edit would otherwise be confusing
  (`"Previously covered X; promoted to packages/AGENTS.md"`).

When a lesson is promoted to a canonical location, remove the entry
and note the destination in the PR description — don't duplicate.

Git history records what existed before. You don't need entries for
that.

## Where this fits in the work-loop

The `work-loop` skill routes an admitted reusable lesson through the public
`project-knowledge` seam. Legacy rows in this file remain curation and
migration input, not the destination for new observations. Other kinds of
learning still go where they already belong (AGENTS.md, skill bodies,
architecture/).

The session-start hook does **not** read this file. Whatever that hook prints
becomes model context before the user's first prompt — and again on resume,
clear, compaction and fork — so replaying agent-captured prose there would turn
one influenced session into a standing instruction for every session after it.
Entries are captured from material the work-loop encountered; being committed
makes them reviewed, not authoritative.

The renderer is still reachable on request, for curation:

```bash
python3 tools/hooks/session-start.py --show-knowledge [--scope <path-or-glob>]
```

The progressive `project-knowledge` capability owns new observations:
`project-knowledge --capture` validates and journals typed evidence;
`project-knowledge --distill` records a terminal disposition and may reconcile
an observation into a canonical topic; and `project-knowledge --enquire` reads
only a coherent committed topic/map snapshot. In a legacy-only repository,
capture and distillation remain unavailable until a reviewed migration
activates that v1 snapshot. The legacy corpus remains readable only for
curation and migration; its writer is retired. New observations use the public
capture seam or end with the named unavailable/refusal outcome without a
legacy append or fallback.

Routing lessons into places that *are* authoritative—`AGENTS.md`, a skill, an
ADR, architecture docs, code, CI, or a lint or test—is part of the shipped
distillation lifecycle. The strongest knowledge is not prose a model remembers;
it is behavior the repository mechanically enforces.
