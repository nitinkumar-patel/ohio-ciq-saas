"""Spec *metadata* drift lint.

This is a `work-loop` **skill script**: it lives at
`packs/core/.apm/skills/work-loop/scripts/lint-spec-status.py` and projects to
every adapter's `.../skills/work-loop/scripts/`, the same way `loop-cohort.py`
does. The agent runs it at the work-loop's finish-time checklist — *available
and agent-invoked, not fail-closed* (there is no PR-open hook event in an
adopter repo). It no-ops gracefully where Python is absent.

It can also run as a **fail-closed CI gate** where a PR event and Python both
exist. Do NOT wire it into the projected `pre-pr` hook body: that body projects
to adopter trees and would mis-fire — the finish-time skill checklist and a CI
gate are the two invocation surfaces. (An earlier design shipped this as a
standalone linter; it now ships as a skill script so it projects to adopters
too.)

It checks six invariants over `docs/specs/*/spec.md`, measured against the
contract pinned in `CONVENTIONS.md` § 4 (Spec metadata contract). Only the
header `- **Status:**` field is checked; `plan.md` status is out of v1 scope.

  (i)   status vocabulary — the leading status token is one of
        {Draft, Approved, Implementing, Shipped, Archived}. The token is the
        first word after `Status:`, truncated at the first ` (`, ` →`, or
        `<!--`, so annotated Frozen statuses like `Shipped (2026-05-26)` and
        `Approved → Shipped (…)` pass. HARD (exit non-zero).
  (ii)  ACs at the ship transition (diff-triggered) — a spec whose header
        status *changes to* `Shipped` in the diff against the base ref must
        have every Acceptance Criterion `[x]`. A `(deferred: <anchor>)` marker
        no longer makes a new ship transition valid; separable work leaves the
        final AC list through an approved amendment and a non-AC follow-on.
        Specs already `Shipped` on the base are grandfathered. If no base ref
        resolves, the invariant is skipped with a warning. HARD when it runs.
  (iii) dangling intra-repo references — both **doc** references (markdown
        links to local `.md` paths) and, since v1.1, repo-relative **code**
        references (full paths rooted at a known top-level dir or an explicit
        relative link, ending in `.py`/`.toml`/`.sh`/`.json`, locator suffix
        stripped) that don't resolve to a file. WARN-ONLY (never changes the
        exit code); promoting it to a hard invariant stays deferred pending
        the observed warn rate.
  (iv)  deferral anchors resolve — every real `(deferred: <slug>)` marker
        resolves against `workspace.toml [backlog].open`, in either entry
        shape: a legacy record's `slug`, or a canonical record's `path`
        reduced by `canonical_entry_anchor`. HARD (exit non-zero).
  (v)   spec↔contract traceability — a spec's
        `- **Contract:**` header (forward ref) names contract file(s) under
        `contracts/<type>/`; each must exist and carry a backward pointer — an
        `x-spec` extension (OpenAPI/AsyncAPI YAML/JSON) or a `contracts/REGISTRY.md`
        row (extensionless formats). WARN-ONLY (never changes the exit code;
        mirrors invariant (iii)). No-ops where the spec names no contract
        (non-API features: empty / "none" / the template placeholder) or no
        `contracts/` tree exists — the common case in repos with no API surface.
  (vi)  Acceptance-Criteria section presence (diff-triggered) — a new spec, or
        a spec whose Acceptance-Criteria section was present at the base ref
        and is missing now, must carry the
        `- **Acceptance Criteria:** none — <reason>` opt-out header. Specs whose
        section was already absent at the base ref are grandfathered. If no
        base ref resolves, the invariant is skipped with a warning. HARD when
        it runs; malformed or contradictory markers are always HARD.

Exit codes: 0 = clean (warnings allowed), 1 = one or more HARD violations.
