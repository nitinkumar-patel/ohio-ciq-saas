"""_loop_guards — the work-loop's shared read-only guard API.

`loop-engine.py transition` used to shell out to `loop-cohort.py` and
`check-spec-status.py` for every read-only FSM guard, costing up to three extra
Python interpreters per transition. The guard *decisions* live here now, so the
engine and those CLIs call one implementation and cannot drift into disagreeing
about whether a transition is legal.

Contract — every public function in this module:

  * takes explicit typed arguments and returns a `GuardResult`;
  * prints NOTHING to stdout or stderr, and carries no CLI prefix in `reason`
    or `message` — each adapter adds its own, so the layer cannot double it
    (which it did once, caught by the golden capture);
  * parses no arguments, reads no `sys.argv`, never calls `sys.exit`;
  * mutates no state file and creates no file anywhere;
  * never spawns a process and never opens a socket.

Two named exceptions to the first bullet, kept because their six mutation-verb
callers consume a reason string directly and rewriting those call sites is out of
scope: `validate_run_id` and `assert_status_legal` return `str | None`.

`spec_dir` precondition: callers pass an absolute, already-resolved,
already-confined `Path`. Confinement stays with the caller that owns it —
`loop-engine._resolve_spec_dir` and `loop-cohort._resolve_spec_dir` (both
repo-root anchored), and `check-spec-status.py`'s bare `resolve()`, which is the
weakest of the three and stays that way under its frozen argument surface. What a
callee can actually check, it does: that `spec_dir` exists and is a directory.
Re-testing "absolute, no `..`" would be dead code, because every caller resolves
first.

NOTE ON `from __future__ import annotations` — deliberately absent, unlike every
sibling script. `GuardResult` is a frozen dataclass, and under future-annotations
`dataclasses` resolves the defining module via `sys.modules.get(cls.__module__)`
with no `None` guard — so class creation raises `AttributeError` in a module loaded
by `exec_module` without being registered in `sys.modules`. Registering instead
would mean hand-rolling the failed-load cleanup that `import` does for free, and
would make this module a session-global singleton whose memoised parser leaks
across tests. PEP 604 unions evaluate natively above the 3.11 floor, so the import
buys nothing here. Probe-verified in both directions.

Every file read goes through `read_managed_json` / `read_managed_text`, which
`lstat`, require a regular file, open `O_RDONLY | O_NOFOLLOW | O_NONBLOCK`, re-check
type and dev/ino on the descriptor, and cap the read. `O_NONBLOCK` is load-bearing,
not defensive: the type pre-check is path-based and racy, and `os.open` on a FIFO
without it blocks forever — which, in-process, would block inside the engine's
critical section until the lock went stale and a second writer was admitted.

Python 3.11+ standard library only. No third-party imports, no packaging, no
installation.

    Four controls the sibling `_statelock` loader lacks, and one reason each:

    1. `lstat` + `S_ISREG` on the module path. A symlink there is followed silently
       by `exec_module`, and this module is executed inside the lock-holding engine.
    2. `sys.dont_write_bytecode` saved, set, and restored to its PRIOR value. Not to
       `False`: these loaders nest under a host interpreter that may have been
       started with `-B`, and clobbering that would be a side effect on unrelated
       imports. Suppressing the write keeps a stale or poisoned `.pyc` from being
       created here; a pre-existing one remains the accepted residual.
    3. Stream swap. `lint-spec-status.py` calls `sys.stdout.reconfigure(...)` at
       module scope. That mutates the stream in place — it does NOT rebind
       `sys.stdout` — so snapshotting the reference would restore nothing. The real
       hazard is the reverse: a caller whose `sys.stdout` lacks `reconfigure` (an
       `io.StringIO`, which is how this pack's own tests capture output) makes that
       line raise. Swapping in a throwaway `TextIOWrapper` keeps the caller's stream
       untouched and always provides `reconfigure`. Deliberately not
       `sys.__stdout__`: that is `None` under pythonw, embedded, and detached-stdio
       contexts, which would turn a working environment into a refusing one.
    4. Completeness. A module truncated at a clean statement boundary loads without
       raising; requiring the symbols the guard path actually uses turns that into a
       load failure instead of a parser missing `parse_status`.

    Every failure is re-raised as `ImportError` so the callers' existing
    `except (ImportError, OSError)` refusal clauses cover it — including
    `SyntaxError`, which derives from `Exception`, not from `ValueError`, and would
    otherwise escape as a traceback.

    Reasons here are PREFIX-FREE, like every other guard's. `check-spec-status.py`

    so embedding one in the reason produced `check-spec-status: check-spec-status:
    …`, which the pre-change goldens caught immediately. A CLI prefix inside the
    guard layer is exactly the CLI concern this layer is supposed to be free of.

    Check ORDER is load-bearing, and also golden-caught. Confinement runs BEFORE the
    single-component rule, so `--file ../outside.md` keeps its existing
    "must be within spec-dir" message rather than being re-diagnosed as a component
    problem. The component rule then catches the genuinely new case: a
    multi-component path that resolves *inside* `spec_dir`, which used to be
    accepted.

    Why single-component matters at all: `O_NOFOLLOW` rejects a symlink only at the
    FINAL component, so `sub/spec.md` with `sub` swapped after the prefix check would
    read outside the directory. And the charset alone admits every dot segment — the
    class `0cb5c213` fixed the day before this change — so dot-only names are
    rejected by segment equality rather than by narrowing the charset, which would
