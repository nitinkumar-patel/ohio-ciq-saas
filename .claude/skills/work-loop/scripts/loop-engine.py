"""loop-engine — work-loop phase FSM validator (Phase 1, Option A).

Validates legal phase ordering, runs read-only guards, and records the
current phase in engine-state.json. Does NOT invoke loop-cohort mutations.
The skill invokes all mutations explicitly.

Two modes in Phase 1:
  code       — full ten-state lifecycle with implementation waves
  spec-plan  — spec/plan drafting only (six-state; terminates at DONE via plan-locked)

Human-wait states in the spec/plan phase:
  SPEC-HUMAN-GATE  — scope decision: does this spec define the right thing to build?
  PLAN-HUMAN-GATE  — build decision: does this plan describe the right way to build it?

# ── the lock-hold budget (ADR-0074 / spec/work-loop-in-process-guards AC22) ─
#
# `cmd_transition` holds the state lock across a read-decide-write section. Three
# numbers are ONE budget, and breaking the ordering silently reinstates the lost
# update this lock exists to prevent:
#
#     statelock timeout (10s)  <  max hold  <  statelock stale_after (300s)
#
# `timeout` must be shorter than a legitimate hold, or contenders give up on a
# live holder. `stale_after` must exceed one, or a merely-slow holder is judged
# dead, its lock is reclaimed, and a second writer is admitted.
#
# THE BUDGET IS IN TWO HALVES, and saying so is the point — the previous version of
# this comment implied one number bounded everything, which stopped being true the
# moment the guards moved in-process.
#
# 1. The SUBPROCESS half is time-bounded:
#
#        max hold = SUBPROCESS_TIMEOUT_S x MAX_SUBPROCESS_CALLS_UNDER_LOCK
#                 = 20 x 2 = 40s, comfortably inside 300s.
#
#    The constant counts INVOCATION EDGES on the reachable call graph, not call
#    sites. There is exactly ONE `subprocess.run` site under the lock — inside
#    `_get_repo_root` — reached along two edges from `cmd_transition`: once via its
#    own `_resolve_spec_dir`, once directly. The `_locked` decorator's
#    `_resolve_spec_dir` runs BEFORE `sl.exclusive()` and is deliberately not
#    counted. It was 6 before the guards moved in-process, which was a conservative
#    bound over a measured maximum of five.
#
# 2. The IN-PROCESS half is byte-bounded, NOT time-bounded. Every file the guard
#    layer reads goes through `read_managed_json` / `read_managed_text`, capped at
#    8 MiB, and `canonical_contract` costs roughly 0.14 s/MiB — so about 1.0 s at
#    the cap. Guard calls are function calls and are deliberately NOT counted as
#    subprocesses; counting them would make the arithmetic describe something it
#    does not measure.
#
#    A byte cap bounds bytes, not seconds. `O_NONBLOCK` closes the reachable local
#    case — a FIFO or device swapped in after the type pre-check, which would
#    otherwise block `os.open` forever — but a stalled network mount can still block
#    `os.read`, and `_recover_pending` reads repo-global state under this same lock.
#    That residual is ACCEPTED and named rather than papered over: its only recovery
#    is the stale-lock reclaim, which is itself the hazard this budget exists to
#    prevent. There is no stdlib way to bound a blocking read without threads or
#    signals, and adding either under the lock would be a worse trade.
#
# `test_loop_concurrency.py`'s budget case derives all of this from source: it walks
# the locked call graph, fails if a subprocess call appears without a `timeout=`,
# fails if this constant disagrees with the edge count, and fails if the inequality
# breaks. Adding a guard cannot quietly break the arithmetic.
